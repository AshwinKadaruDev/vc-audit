# Take-Home Assignment: VC Audit Tool

**Timeline:** 24-48 hours

**Deliverables:** Working code in a public GitHub repo + short README (max 1 page). Includes instructions for running.

**Follow-up:** 30-minute walkthrough interview covering design, reasoning, and technical implementation

## Problem Overview

Auditors reviewing venture capital portfolios need to estimate the fair value of private, illiquid portfolio companies. The goal of this exercise is not to produce a “correct” valuation, but to design and implement a structured, auditable workflow that helps auditors efficiently arrive at a consistent, well-documented fair value estimate.

This task is distinct from valuing publicly traded companies, which have a readily available market price. Private companies lack this price and often have sparse or non-standardized financial data. The challenge is to build a system that can value these private assets using the best available data, which might include internal company metrics, data from the last funding round, or data from publicly-traded comparable companies.

Your solution should demonstrate how you translate a business problem into a sound, maintainable backend system.

## Potential Methodologies (for inspiration)

A key part of this exercise is choosing a valuation methodology and building a structured workflow around it. Your system should be able to ingest data, apply a chosen model, and output the result. We are not testing your financial modeling expertise, but rather your ability to translate one of these business-logic workflows into code.

You are free to choose your approach. Examples of methodologies you could model include:

### Comparable Company Analysis (Comps)

- **Logic:** The system identifies a set of comparable public companies (based on sector, size, etc.).
- **Data:** It would fetch their financial data (e.g., Revenue, EBITDA) and Enterprise Value.
- **Calculation:** It determines a relevant valuation multiple (e.g., Enterprise Value / Revenue).
- **Application:** It then applies this average multiple to the private portfolio company's own revenue (e.g., 8x EV/Revenue * $10M Revenue = $80M Fair Value).

### Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)

- **Logic:** The system projects a company's future cash flows and discounts them back to their present value.
- **Data:** This approach would assume you are given a set of detailed financial projections for the portfolio company (e.g., 5-year forecasts for revenue, expenses, and capital expenditures).
- **Calculation:** The system would apply a discount rate (e.g., a WACC) to these future cash flows.
- **Application:** The sum of the discounted cash flows would be the estimated fair value.

### Last Round (Market-Adjusted) Valuation

- **Logic:** This is a common "mark-to-market" approach. It starts with the valuation from the company's most recent funding round and adjusts it based on public market performance.
- **Data:** The inputs would be the company's last_post_money_valuation, the date_of_last_round, and a data source for a relevant public index (e.g., the Nasdaq Composite).
- **Calculation:** The system calculates the percentage change in the public index from the date_of_last_round to the present.
- **Application:** This percentage change is then applied to the last_post_money_valuation to produce a new, auditable fair value estimate.

## Requirements

### Inputs

- Portfolio company name (e.g., "Basis AI", "Inflo")
- Key data required by your chosen methodology. Examples:
  - For Comps: sector, revenue
  - For DCF: financial_projections (could be a path to a file or a JSON object)
  - For Last Round: last_post_money_valuation, last_round_date

### Outputs

- Estimated fair value (numeric or range)
- Key inputs and assumptions used (e.g., "Used 8.2x EV/Revenue multiple", "Used 15% discount rate")
- Citations or data sources (e.g., "Public comp data from Yahoo Finance API [mocked]", "Internal projections dated Q3 2025")
- Explanation of how the estimate was derived (structured or narrative, e.g., "Valuation based on peer-group median multiple of 8.2x applied to $10M LTM Revenue.")

## Core Expectations

- Backend service that takes an input and returns the valuation output.
- Strong code quality, organization, and documentation.
- Clear workflow from data ingestion → valuation logic → output.
- Traceable, auditable process: It should be easy to understand how the result was produced.

## Preferred

- Structured approach to problem solving (clear steps, modular design).
- If external data is used (e.g., public APIs, datasets), handle errors gracefully (mocking is perfectly fine).
- Thoughtful UX – CLI tool is fine, or simple web frontend. Whatever you need to communicate how auditors would use this in practice. Wireframes/sketches also acceptable.

## Not Required

- Extensive deployment setup
- Highly accurate financial modeling (the logic is more important than the numbers)

## Deliverables

1. Source code in a public GitHub repository
2. README including:
   - Overview of the problem and your chosen approach/methodology.
   - Key design decisions and tradeoffs.
   - Setup instructions and usage example.
   - Notes on potential improvements if you had more time.
   - (Optional) Screenshot or diagram of UX/workflow.
3. Set up time with us to review live
